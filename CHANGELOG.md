## 2.1.1

Deprecated in favor of the new functionality in core.

## 2.1.0

In the presence of this module, Apostrophe's stock stylesheets should not be pushed either. On the other hand, project-level stylesheets and JavaScript assets configured for the `apostrophe-assets` module *should* be pushed unless they have an explicit `when` setting. Thanks to regmeg.

## 2.0.3

Fixed a bug which prevented video widgets to render in IE11. Thanks to 
Leonhard Melzer.

## 2.0.2

Fixed a bug in `apos.lean.assign`.

## 2.0.1

Fixed a bug that prevented editing an existing rich text widget when the module is active. Also added `apos.lean.closest`.

## 2.0.0

Initial release.
